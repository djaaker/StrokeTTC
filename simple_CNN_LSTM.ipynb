    "To help you prepare your EEG data for input into a ResNet model, we can go through the steps of loading the .edf files, preprocessing the data, and setting up the format for input into ResNet. Here's an outline of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load .edf files**: We'll use the `pyEDFlib` library to load the EEG data.\n",
    "2. **Preprocess the EEG data**: This may involve normalization or other preprocessing specific to EEG signals.\n",
    "3. **Label encoding**: We'll ensure that the labels (normal or abnormal) are mapped into numerical values.\n",
    "4. **Reshape data for ResNet**: ResNet typically expects input in a specific shape (e.g., (batch_size, height, width, channels)), so we'll format the EEG data accordingly."
